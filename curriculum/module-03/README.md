# Module 3: Tools — Giving AI Hands

> **Key Question:** How does an agent interact with the real world?

---

## 3.1 What is a Tool?

A tool is a **function the AI can call** to do something in the real world.

Without tools, the AI can only generate text. With tools, it can read files, run commands, search the web, call APIs — anything you expose to it.

```
Without tools:                    With tools:
  You: "Read my config"            You: "Read my config"
  AI: "I can't read files."        AI: [calls fs_read("config.yaml")]
                                   AI: "Your config has 3 sections..."
```

## 3.2 Anatomy of a Tool

Every tool has three parts:

```json
{
  "name": "word_count",                              ← 1. Name (how AI refers to it)
  "description": "Count words, lines, chars in text", ← 2. Description (how AI decides to use it)
  "inputSchema": {                                    ← 3. Parameters (what AI needs to provide)
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "text": {"type": "string", "description": "Text to analyze"}
    },
    "required": ["text"]
  }
}
```

The **description is critical** — it's literally how the AI decides whether to use this tool. A bad description = AI never picks it or picks it at the wrong time.

## 3.3 Built-in Tools (Kiro)

| Tool | What it does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `fs_read` | Read files | Read README.md |
| `fs_write` | Write/edit files | Create a new file |
| `execute_bash` | Run shell commands | `npm test` |
| `grep` | Search text in files | Find "TODO" in src/ |
| `glob` | Find files by pattern | Find all *.py files |
| `code` | Code intelligence (AST) | Find function definitions |
| `use_aws` | AWS API calls | List S3 buckets |
| `web_search` | Search the web | Look up documentation |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch URL content | Read a webpage |
| `knowledge` | Persistent search | Search indexed docs |
| `todo_list` | Track tasks | Create/complete tasks |
| `subagent` | Spawn other agents | Parallel research |

## 3.4 Tool vs Subagent

This confuses people. A subagent IS a tool — but a special one:

```
Regular tool:
  Agent → grep("TODO") → results → done
  One call. One result. Simple.

Subagent tool:
  Agent → subagent({stages: [...]})
            ├── spawns Agent A (own session, own tools)
            ├── spawns Agent B (own session, own tools)
            └── collects results from both
  Creates new agents. They have their own tools. Complex.
```

| | Regular Tool | Subagent |
|---|---|---|
| Who does the work? | The tool itself | Other agents |
| Has its own session? | No | Yes |
| Can use tools? | No — it IS a tool | Yes — spawned agents have tools |
| Parallelism? | No | Yes |

**Analogy:** A screwdriver (regular tool) vs hiring contractors (subagent). Both are "tools" in your toolbox, but one creates workers.

## 3.5 Custom Tools via MCP

You can't add built-in tools, but you can create custom tools via **MCP servers** (Model Context Protocol).

An MCP server is a small program that:
1. Speaks JSON-RPC
2. Exposes tools with names, descriptions, and parameter schemas
3. Connects to Kiro via stdio (local) or HTTP (remote)

```
┌──────────┐    JSON-RPC     ┌──────────────────┐
│   Kiro   │ ──────────────▶ │  Your MCP Server │
│  Agent   │ ◀────────────── │  (Python/Node/Go)│
└──────────┘                 └──────────────────┘
```

Example — a custom MCP server in Python that exposes a `word_count` tool:

```python
# When Kiro sends: {"method": "tools/list"}
# Server responds with tool definitions

# When Kiro sends: {"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "word_count", "arguments": {"text": "hello"}}}
# Server responds with: {"result": {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Words: 1"}]}}
```

See `hands-on/mcp-server/server.py` for a complete working example.

## 3.6 Tool Permissions

Not all tools should run freely. Kiro has a permission system:

```json
{
  "tools": ["fs_read", "fs_write", "execute_bash"],
  "allowedTools": ["fs_read"],
  "toolsSettings": {
    "fs_write": {
      "allowedPaths": ["src/**"],
      "deniedPaths": ["node_modules/**"]
    },
    "execute_bash": {
      "allowedCommands": ["npm test", "npm run build"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `tools` | Which tools are available at all |
| `allowedTools` | Which tools run without asking you |
| `toolsSettings` | Fine-grained restrictions per tool |

Tools NOT in `allowedTools` will prompt you: "Allow fs_write to src/app.js? [y/n]"

## 3.7 Hooks — Intercepting Tool Calls

Hooks let you run custom scripts before/after tool execution:

```
preToolUse hook:
  Agent wants to call fs_write("production.env")
       │
       ▼
  Your hook script runs → checks the path
       │
  exit 0 → allow it
  exit 2 → BLOCK it (returns error to AI)
```

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {"matcher": "fs_write", "command": "~/.kiro/hooks/validate-write.sh"}
    ]
  }
}
```

This is how you add safety rails without modifying the agent or model.

## Exercise 3.1: Match the Tool

What tool would the AI use for each request?

| Request | Tool |
|---------|------|
| "Read my package.json" | ? |
| "Find all files named *.test.js" | ? |
| "Search for 'deprecated' in the codebase" | ? |
| "Run the test suite" | ? |
| "Compare React vs Vue vs Svelte" | ? |
| "List my S3 buckets" | ? |

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

| Request | Tool |
|---------|------|
| "Read my package.json" | `fs_read` |
| "Find all files named *.test.js" | `glob` |
| "Search for 'deprecated' in the codebase" | `grep` |
| "Run the test suite" | `execute_bash` (npm test) |
| "Compare React vs Vue vs Svelte" | `subagent` (parallel research) |
| "List my S3 buckets" | `use_aws` |

</details>

## Exercise 3.2: Test the MCP Server

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
# List available tools
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | python3 kiro-concepts-demo/hands-on/mcp-server/server.py

# Call a tool
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"word_count","arguments":{"text":"hello world foo bar"}}}' | python3 kiro-concepts-demo/hands-on/mcp-server/server.py
```

Questions:
1. How many tools does the server expose?
2. What's the word count result?
3. What happens if you call a tool that doesn't exist?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

1. Two tools: `get_system_info` and `word_count`
2. Words: 4, Lines: 1, Chars: 19
3. You get a JSON-RPC error: `{"error": {"code": -32601, "message": "Unknown tool: ..."}}`

</details>

## Exercise 3.3: Design a Tool

Design a tool definition (just the JSON schema) for a tool that:
- Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Takes a number and a direction ("c_to_f" or "f_to_c")

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```json
{
  "name": "convert_temperature",
  "description": "Convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "value": {"type": "number", "description": "Temperature value to convert"},
      "direction": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["c_to_f", "f_to_c"],
        "description": "Conversion direction"
      }
    },
    "required": ["value", "direction"]
  }
}
```

The description is key — it tells the AI WHEN to use this tool. If someone says "what's 100°C in Fahrenheit?", the AI matches that intent to this description.

## Check Your Understanding

1. What are the three parts of a tool definition?
2. Why is the tool description so important?
3. How is a subagent different from a regular tool?
4. How do you add custom tools to Kiro?
5. What does `allowedTools` do vs `tools`?
